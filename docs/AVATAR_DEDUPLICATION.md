# Avatar & Product Deduplication

## Overview

As of the latest update, all deduplication logic for avatars and products is handled **exclusively in Make.com**. The frontend and backend no longer perform any duplicate checks, webhook skipping, or avatar reuse logic. The app always sends a webhook to Make.com, which decides the correct flow based on the data provided.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend** always sends a webhook to Make.com with the current product/avatar context.
2. **Make.com Scenario** uses a router and filters to:
   - Create new product and/or avatar if they do not exist.
   - Return existing data immediately if both already exist (no new data is created).
   - Create only an avatar if the product exists but no avatar is connected.
3. **Frontend** receives the response and autofills or proceeds as appropriate.

## Why This Change?
- **Centralizes business logic** in one place (Make.com), reducing bugs and maintenance overhead.
- **Prevents race conditions** and edge cases that can occur with async duplicate checks in the app.
- **Simplifies the codebase** and makes future changes easier.

## What to Remove from the App
- All code that checks for duplicates before webhook calls.
- All code that skips or blocks webhook calls based on local duplicate checks.
- All code that bypasses or short-circuits the creative flow if a duplicate is found.
- All tests and documentation related to frontend/backend deduplication.

## What to Keep in the App
- Always send the webhook to Make.com, regardless of local data state.
- Handle the Make.com response to autofill or proceed as needed.

## Make.com Scenario (Example)
- **Route 1:** Neither product nor avatar exists → create both.
- **Route 2:** Product exists, avatar does not → create avatar only.
- **Route 3:** Both exist → return existing data immediately.

## Testing
- Test all three scenarios above.
- Ensure the app never skips the webhook based on local checks.
